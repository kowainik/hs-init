{- | Golden tests for @summoner@.

In the @test/golden@ folder we now have two projects that are created by
@summoner@.

* @fullProject@ – the project that has all options enabled.
* @smallProject@ – the project that has limited options enabled.

The purpose of this tests is to check that with the corresponding 'Settings'
the tool creates the expected project.
