    - [ ] [summoner-tui/CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/blob/master/summoner-tui/CHANGELOG.md).
- [ ] Keep code style used in the changed files (see [style-guide](https://github.com/kowainik/org/blob/master/style-guide.md#haskell-style-guide) for more details).
- [ ] Use the [`stylish-haskell` file](https://github.com/kowainik/summoner/blob/master/.stylish-haskell.yaml).
- [ ] Update documentation (README, haddock) if required.
- [ ] Create a new test project using `summoner` and check that the changes work as expected.

*Hint:* Add the `[ci skip]` text to the docs-only related commit's name, so no need to wait for CI to pass.
