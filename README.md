Summoner is the tool for creating fully configured production Haskell projects.

## Demo

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/198918.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/198918)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

To start using it make sure you have the next tools installed on your machine:

* [`Stack`](http://haskellstack.org) or [`cabal`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
* [`git`](https://git-scm.com)
* [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub)
* [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se)

### Installation

The installation process can be done with the one simple command:

    $ cabal new-install summoner

or

    $ stack install summoner

or directly from GitHub.

You can turn on the bash auto-completion by running the following command:

```
$ source <(summon --bash-completion-script `which summon`)
```

After that, you can call `summon` with the required command. To create a
project, use `summon new` command specifying the prefered CLI options, follow
the instructions during the interactive process of the project creation, and a
new project would be created in a subfolder as well as a repository under your
GitHub account (if requested).

### Usage

There are several options how to set particular configurations for the new projects:

1. Default configuration file (`~/.summoner.toml`).
2. Explicitly specified configuration file by `--file FILENAME` option (used
   instead of the default one if specified).
3. Options that are stated by CLI arguments.
4. Interactively inputed answers during work of the `summon` command
  (for the options that were not specified on previous steps).

So, the configuration uses [`Partial Options Monoid Pattern`](https://medium.com/@jonathangfischoff/the-partial-options-monoid-pattern-31914a71fc67).

If none of the mentioned above cases used then the configuration will be built interactively.

#### Configurations

##### `.toml` files:

Here is the list of the options that could be configured for your needs:

###### Global keys

* `cabal` â€“ `true` if you want to build you project with `cabal`,
             `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `stack` â€“ `true` if you want to build your project with `stack`,
             `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `owner` â€“ `GitHub` login.
* `fullName` â€“ full name.
* `email` â€“ e-mail address.
* `license` â€“ license (possible options: `MIT`, `BSD2`, `BSD3`, `GPL-2`, `GPL-3`,
              `LGPL-2.1`, `LGPL-3`, `AGPL-3`, `Apache-2.0`, `MPL-2.0`).
* `ghcVersions` â€“ `summoner` uses default `GHC-8.2.2`. But additionally you can specify other versions.
                   For each version `x.y.z` the `stack-x.y.z.yaml` will be created.
* `github` â€“ `true` if you want to turn on `GitHub` integration by default,
             `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `travis` â€“ `true` if you want to turn on `Travis` integration by default,
             `false` if you don't. Ignored if `github = false`.
             If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `appveyor` â€“ `true` if you want to turn on `AppVeyor` integration by default,
               `false` if you don't. Ignored if `github = false`.
               If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `private` â€“ `true` if you want to create private repositories by default,
              `false` if you don't. Ignored if `github = false`.
              If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `lib` â€“ `true` if you want to create `src` folder with dummy `Lib.hs` file and library target by default,
          `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `exe` â€“ `true` if you want to create `app` folder with dummy `Main.hs` file and executable target by default,
          `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `test` â€“ `true` if you want to create `test` folder with dummy `Spec.hs` file and test target by default,
          `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `bench` â€“ `true` if you want to create `benchmark` folder  with `Main.hs` file with [`gauge`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gauge)
            library usage example by default,
          `false` if you don't. If not specified it would be asked during each run of the `summoner`.
* `extensions` â€“ List of the default extensions to add into `default-extensions` section in the `.cabal`.
* `warnings` â€“ List of the default checks and warnings to add into `ghc-options` section in the `.cabal`.
* `stylish.*` â€” `stylish.file` to provide the absolute file path to the
  `.stylish-haskell.yaml` file to use in the project. `stylish.url` to provide
  the link to the `.stylish-haskell.yaml` file to use in the project. In case of
  the absense or wrong path/link no `.stylish-haskell.yaml` file is created.
* `contributing.*` â€” `contributing.file` to provide the absolute file path to the
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to use in the project. `contributing.url` to provide
  the link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to use in the project. In case of
  the absense or wrong path/link no `CONTRIBUTING` file is created.

###### Custom prelude options

Should be specified inside `[prelude]` table.

* `package` â€“ Name of the package of the custom prelude you'd like to use in the project (doesn't work without `module` field).
* `module` â€“ Name of the module of the custom prelude you'd like to use in the project (doesn't work without `package` field).

###### Examples

See an example of [the configuration for projects of the `Kowainik` organization](https://github.com/kowainik/org/blob/master/.summoner.toml).

By default, the `summoner` looks for the configuration file (`.summoner.toml`) in home directory.

The other way to specify some particular `.toml` file is `summon new PROJECTNAME --file FILEPATH` command.

**`summon show`** command:

```

Available commands:
  ghc                      Show available ghc versions
  license                  Show available licenses
  license [LICENSE_NAME]   Show specific license text

Available options:
  -h, --help               Show this help text
```

The options to be enabled/disabled can be specified while running the command.
If any of the applicable command options wasn't tagged as enabled/disabled, then
the question is asked during the work of the tool.

For example,

```
  summon new my-project with -letgcpw without -b --prelude-package relude --prelude-module Relude
```

creates the fully functional project which uses custom prelude `relude`, contains
library, executable file, tests and create private repository on [github](https://github.com)
integrated with `Travis-CI`, `AppVeyor-CI`, but benchmarks won't be attached to this one.

But when calling this command

```
  summon new my-project
```

the tool asks about every particular option, rather you'd like to have it
or not in your project.

## Features

If you're running the `summoner` with all options enabled a project with the following
hierarchy is created:

```
project-name
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Main.hs
â”œâ”€â”€ benchmark
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Main.hs
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectName.hs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Prelude.hs
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Spec.hs
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ project-name.cabal
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Setup.hs
â”œâ”€â”€ stack.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ appveyor.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ .travis.yml
```

Moreover, a repository with one commit at master is added with enabled Travis CI for that.

## GHC options

The `-Wall` option is added to every stanza.

The following warning checks are added by default to executable, tests and benchmark stanzas:

    -threaded
    -rtsopts
    -with-rtsopts=-N

If warnings are not explicitly stated in the configuration file, then the
following ghc-options are added to all stanzas.

    -Wincomplete-uni-patterns
    -Wincomplete-record-updates
    -Wcompat
    -Widentities
    -Wredundant-constraints      (ghc >= 8.0)
    -fhide-source-paths          (ghc >= 8.2.2)
    -Wmissing-export-lists       (ghc >= 8.4.1)
    -Wpartial-fields             (ghc >= 8.4.1)
